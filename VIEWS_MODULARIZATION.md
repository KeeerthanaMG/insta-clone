# Views Modularization Complete

## Summary

The large `views.py` file has been successfully split into three modular components:

### 1. `views.py` (Router File)
- **Purpose**: Simple import router that combines all views
- **Content**: Import statements that bring together core and CTF views
- **Size**: ~18 lines (down from 1300+ lines)

### 2. `core_views.py` (Production-Safe Views)
- **Purpose**: Contains all normal application logic
- **Views Included**:
  - `PostViewSet` - CRUD operations for posts
  - `CommentViewSet` - Comment management
  - `LoginView`, `RegisterView`, `LogoutView` - Authentication
  - `CurrentUserView`, `UserProfileView` - User management
  - `FollowUserView`, `UnfollowUserView` - Social features
  - `NotificationListView`, `NotificationReadView` - Notifications
  - `FeedView`, `UserPostsView` - Content feeds
  - `ThreadListView`, `StartThreadView`, `MessageListView` - Chat system
  - Helper functions like `create_notification()`

### 3. `ctf_views.py` (CTF Challenge Views)
- **Purpose**: Contains intentionally vulnerable endpoints for educational purposes
- **Views Included**:
  - `trigger_bug_found()` - CTF scoring mechanism
  - `SetUserRoleView` - Privilege escalation vulnerability
  - `serve_post_image()` - Private post viewing vulnerability
  - `VulnerableMessageListView` - IDOR vulnerability in chat messages
  - `SavePostView` - Race condition vulnerability
  - `DebugThreadsView` - Debug endpoint
  - **XSS Detection System** - Detects XSS attempts in comment submissions

## Benefits

### ✅ **Improved Maintainability**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier to locate specific functionality
- Reduced file size makes navigation easier

### ✅ **Educational Value**
- CTF vulnerabilities are clearly separated
- Production-safe code is isolated
- Intent is explicit in file organization

### ✅ **Development Workflow**
- Developers can focus on core features without vulnerability distractions
- CTF challenges can be developed independently
- No risk of accidentally deploying vulnerabilities to production

### ✅ **Backwards Compatibility**
- All existing imports continue to work
- URL routing remains unchanged
- API endpoints maintain the same behavior

## File Structure
```
backend/core/
├── views.py          # Router (18 lines)
├── core_views.py     # Production views (~700 lines)
├── ctf_views.py      # CTF challenges (~200 lines)
└── views_backup.py   # Original file backup
```

## Next Steps

The modular structure is now ready for:
1. **Profile Page Enhancements** - Add tab functionality to `core_views.py`
2. **Save Post Race Condition** - Complete the `SavePostView` in `ctf_views.py`
3. **Frontend Integration** - Update React components to use the new tab system
4. **Additional CTF Challenges** - Easy to add new vulnerabilities to `ctf_views.py`

All functionality has been preserved while dramatically improving code organization and maintainability.

## CTF Vulnerabilities Available

### 1. **Privilege Escalation** (50 points)
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/users/set_role/`
- **Payload**: `{"role": "admin"}`
- **Description**: Attempt to escalate privileges to admin role
- **Note**: Points awarded only once per user

### 2. **Private Post Viewing** (100 points)
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/posts/image/<post_id>/`
- **Description**: Access private post images without authorization
- **Note**: Points awarded only once per user

### 3. **IDOR in Chat Messages** (75 points)
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/messages/threads/<thread_id>/`
- **Description**: Access chat messages without being a participant
- **Note**: Points awarded only once per user

### 4. **Race Condition in Saved Posts** (50 points)
- **Trigger**: Rapidly click save button 10+ times within 5 seconds
- **Description**: Exploit concurrency issues in save/unsave functionality
- **Note**: Points awarded only once per user

### 5. **XSS in Comment System** (75 points)
- **Trigger**: Submit comment with XSS payload like `<script>alert("XSS")</script>`
- **Description**: Attempt to inject malicious scripts in comments
- **Note**: Points awarded only once per user

### 6. **SQL Injection in User Search** (100 points)
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/users/search?search=<payload>`
- **Trigger**: Submit search with SQL injection payload like `' OR 1=1 --` (press Enter to submit)
- **Description**: Attempt to inject malicious SQL in user search functionality
- **Note**: Points awarded only once per user

### Bug Discovery System
- Uses atomic transactions to prevent double counting
- Each bug can only be solved once per user
- Points and bug counts are updated atomically using database F() expressions
- User stats refresh automatically after bug discovery
